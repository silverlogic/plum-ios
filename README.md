Plum.cash is an allowance management app designed to help young people learn how to manage their money. 
Parents link their and their kid's Visa cards to the app, and use the app to send money from the parent to the kid based on whether or not the kid has completed a set of chores. 
Furthermore, parents can set controls over what sort of merchant the kid can spend his or her money on by selecting merchant types in the app.
